Should your program diverge from consensus, its security is weakened or destroyed. The cause of the divergence doesn't matter: it could be a bug in your program, it could be an error in this documentation which you implemented as described, or it could be you do everything right but other software on the <<glossary:network>> [behaves unexpectedly](https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-03-11-chain-fork) as in the case of Bitcoin's v0.8 chain fork. The specific cause will not matter to the users of your software whose wealth is lost.\n\nThe only correct specification of consensus behavior is the actual behavior of programs on the network which maintain consensus. As that behavior is subject to arbitrary inputs in a large variety of unique environments, it cannot ever be fully documented here or anywhere else.\n\nIn addition, we also warn you that this documentation has not been extensively reviewed by Dash experts and so likely contains numerous errors.",
