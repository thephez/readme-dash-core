From the Help menu, you can access a console where you can enter the RPC commands used throughout this document.\n\n* `dashd` is more useful for programming: it provides a full peer which you can interact with through RPCs to port 9998 (or 19998 for <<glossary:testnet>> / 19898 for regtest).\n\n* `dash-cli` allows you to send RPC commands to `dashd` from the command line.  For example, `dash-cli help`",
