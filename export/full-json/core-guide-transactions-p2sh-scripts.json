Receivers do care about the script conditions and, if they want, they can ask spenders to use a particular <<glossary:pubkey script>>. Unfortunately, custom pubkey scripts are less convenient than short Dash <<glossary:addresses>> and there was no standard way to communicate them between programs prior to widespread implementation of the BIP70 Payment Protocol discussed later.\n\nTo solve these problems, pay-to-script-hash (<<glossary:P2SH>>) transactions were created in 2012 to let a spender create a pubkey script containing a hash of a second script, the <<glossary:redeem script>>.\n\nThe basic P2SH workflow, illustrated below, looks almost identical to the <<glossary:P2PKH>> workflow. Bob creates a redeem script with whatever script he wants, hashes the redeem script, and provides the <<glossary:redeem script>> hash to Alice. Alice creates a P2SH-style <<glossary:output>> containing Bob's redeem script hash.\n\n![Creating A P2SH Redeem Script And Hash](https://dash-docs.github.io/img/dev/en-creating-p2sh-output.svg)\n\nWhen Bob wants to spend the <<glossary:output>>, he provides his <<glossary:signature>> along with the full (serialized) redeem script in the <<glossary:signature script>>. The peer-to-peer <<glossary:network>> ensures the full redeem script hashes to the same value as the script hash Alice put in her output; it then processes the redeem script exactly as it would if it were the primary pubkey script, letting Bob spend the output if the redeem script does not return false.\n\n![Unlocking A P2SH Output For Spending](https://dash-docs.github.io/img/dev/en-unlocking-p2sh-output.svg)\n\nThe hash of the redeem script has the same properties as a pubkey hash---so it can be transformed into the standard Dash address format with only one small change to differentiate it from a standard address. This makes collecting a P2SH-style address as simple as collecting a P2PKH-style address. The hash also obfuscates any public keys in the redeem script, so P2SH scripts are as secure as P2PKH pubkey hashes.",
