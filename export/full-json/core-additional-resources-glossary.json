 "body": "# 51 percent attack\n\nThe ability of someone controlling a majority of network hash rate to revise transaction history and prevent new transactions from confirming.\n\n# Address\n\nA 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address. Currently the most common way users exchange payment information.\n\n# Base58\n\nThe method used in Dash for converting 160-bit hashes into P2PKH and P2SH addresses. Also used in other parts of Dash, such as encoding private keys for backup in WIP format. Not the same as other base58 implementations.\n\n# Base58check\n\nThe method used in Dash for converting 160-bit hashes into P2PKH and P2SH addresses. Also used in other parts of Dash, such as encoding private keys for backup in WIP format. Not the same as other base58 implementations.\n\n# BIP32\n\nThe Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol (BIP32), which allows creating child keys from parent keys in a hierarchy. Wallets using the HD protocol are called HD wallets.\n\n# BIP70 payment protocol\n\nThe protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers.\n\n# Block\n\nOne or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain.\n\n# Block chain\n\nA chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain.\n\n# Block header\n\nAn 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work.\n\n# Block height\n\nThe number of blocks preceding a particular block on a block chain. For example, the genesis block has a height of zero because zero block preceded it.\n\n# Block reward\n\nThe amount that miners may claim as a reward for creating a block. Equal to the sum of the block subsidy (newly available duffs) plus the transactions fees paid by transactions included in the block.\n\n# Block size limit\n\nThe maximum size in bytes that the consensus rules allow a block to be. The current block size limit is 2000000 bytes.\n\n# Blocks-first sync\n\nSynchronizing the block chain by downloading each block from a peer and then validating it.\n\n# blocktransactions\n\nA P2P Networking data structure used to provide some of the transactions in a block as requested.\n\n# blocktransactionsrequest\n\nA P2P Networking data structure used to list transaction indexes in a block being requested by a peer.\n\n# Bloom filter\n\nA filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes.\n\n# Chain code\n\nIn HD wallets, 256 bits of entropy added to the public and private keys to help them generate secure child keys; the master chain code is usually derived from a seed along with the master private key\n\n# ChainLock\n\nChainLocks are a feature enabling near instant consensus on the valid chain. ChainLocks use Long-Living Masternode Quroums to mitigate 51 percent attacks and reduce uncertainty when receiving funds.\n\n# Change output\n\nAn output in a transaction which returns duffs to the spender, thus preventing too much of the input value from going to transaction fees.\n\n# Child key\n\nIn HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key. The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code.\n\n# Child pays for parent\n\nSelecting transactions for mining not just based on their fees but also based on the fees of their ancestors (parents) and descendants (children).\n\n# Child private key\n\nIn HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key. The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code.\n\n# Child public key\n\nIn HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key. The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code.\n\n# Coinbase\n\nA special field used as the sole input for coinbase transactions.

A confirmed transaction has a confirmation score of one or higher.\n\n# Consensus\n\nWhen several nodes (usually most nodes on the network) all have the same blocks in their locally-validated best block chain.\n\n# Consensus rules\n\nThe block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes.\n\n# Dark Gravity Wave\n\nAn open source difficulty-adjusting algorithm for Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies that was first used in Dash. Difficulty adjusts every block based on historical statistical data to ensure consistent block issuance regardless of hash rate fluctuation.\n\n# Dash address encoding\n\nThe method used in Dash for converting 160-bit hashes into P2PKH and P2SH addresses. Also used in other parts of Dash, such as encoding private keys for backup in WIP format.

One dash equals 100,000,000 duffs.\n\n# Devnet\n\nA development environment in which developers can obtain and spend duffs that have no real-world value on a network that is very similar to the Dash mainnet. Multiple independent devnets can coexist without interference. Devnets can be either public or private.\n\n# Difficulty\n\nHow difficult it is to find a block relative to the difficulty of finding the easiest possible block. The easiest possible block has a proof-of-work difficulty of 1.\n\n# DNS seed\n\nA DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery.\n\n# Double spend\n\nA transaction that uses the same input as an already broadcast transaction. The attempt of duplication, deceit, or conversion, will be adjudicated when only one of the transactions is recorded in the blockchain.\n\n# Duffs\n\nDenominations of Dash value, usually measured in fractions of a dash but sometimes measured in multiples of a duff. One dash equals 100,000,000 duffs.\n\n# ECDSA private key\n\nThe private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key.\n\n# ECDSA signatures\n\nA value related to a public key which could only have reasonably been created by someone who has the private key that created that public key. Used in Dash to authorize spending duffs previously sent to a public key.\n\n# Escrow contract\n\nA transaction in which a spender and receiver place funds in a 2-of-2 (or other m-of-n) multisig output so that neither can spend the funds until they're both satisfied with some external outcome.\n\n# Evolution\n\nCode name for a decentralized currency platform built on the Dash blockchain technology.

Can also happen as part of an attack.\n\n# Genesis block\n\nThe first block in the Dash block chain.\n\n# Hard fork\n\nA permanent divergence in the block chain, commonly occurs when non-upgraded nodes can't validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow newer consensus rules.\n\n# Hardened extended key\n\nA variation on HD wallet extended keys where only the hardened extended private key can derive child keys. This prevents compromise of the chain code plus any private key from putting the whole wallet at risk.\n\n# Hardened extended private key\n\nA variation on HD wallet extended keys where only the hardened extended private key can derive child keys.
