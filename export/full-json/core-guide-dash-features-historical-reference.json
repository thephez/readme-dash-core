It describes features that have been redesigned and no longer operate as described below.**\",\n  \"title\": \"Deprecated Content\"\n}\n[/block]\n# InstantSend (original)\n[block:callout]\n{\n  \"type\": \"warning\",\n  \"body\": \"**Please see [here for details of the current InstantSend design](core-guide-dash-features-instantsend).**\"\n}\n[/block]\nDash Core's InstantSend feature provides a way to lock transaction inputs and enable secure, instantaneous transactions. Since Dash Core 0.13.0, any qualifying transaction is automatically upgraded to InstantSend by the network without a need for the sending wallet to explicitly request it. For these simple transactions (those containing 4 or fewer inputs), the previous requirement for a special InstantSend transaction fee was also removed. The criteria for determining eligibility can be found in the lists of limitations below.\n\nThe following video provides an overview with a good introduction to the details including the InstantSend vulnerability that was fixed in Dash Core 0.12.2. Some specific points in the video are listed here for quick reference:\n\n - 2:00 - InstantSend restrictions\n - 5:00 - Masternode quorum creation\n - 6:00 - Input locking\n - 7:45 - Quorum score calculation / Requirement for block confirmations\n - 9:00 - Description of Dash Core pre-0.12.2 InstantSend vulnerability\n - 13:00 - Description of vulnerability fix / Post Dash Core 0.12.2 operation\n\n[block:embed]\n{\n  \"html\": false,\n  \"url\": \"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n4PELomRiFY?rel=0;start=0\",\n  \"title\": \"Matt Robertson - Instant Send - The Dash Conference - YouTube\",\n  \"favicon\": \"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/favicon.ico\",\n  \"iframe\": true,\n  \"width\": \"\",\n  \"height\": \"\"\n}\n[/block]\n*InstantSend Data Flow*\n\n| **InstantSend Client** | **Direction**  | **Peers**   | **Description** |\n| --- | :---: | --- | --- |\n| [`inv` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#section-inv) (ix)          | \u2192 |                         | Client sends inventory for transaction lock request\n|                             | \u2190 | [`getdata` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#section-getdata) (ix)  | Peer responds with request for transaction lock request\n| `ix` message                | \u2192 |                         | Client sends InstantSend transaction lock request\n|                             | \u2190 | [`inv` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#section-inv) (txlvote) | Masternodes in the [quorum](core-guide-dash-features-masternode-quorums#section-quorum-selection) respond with votes\n| [`getdata` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#section-getdata) (txlvote) | \u2192 |                         | Client requests vote\n|                             | \u2190 | `txlvote` message       | Peer responds with vote\n\nOnce an InstantSend lock has been requested, the `instantsend` field of various RPCs (e.g. the [`getmempoolentry` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-blockchain#section-get-mem-pool-entry)) is set to `true`. Then, if a sufficient number of votes approve the transaction lock, the InstantSend transaction is approved the `instantlock` field of the RPC is set to `true`.\n\nIf an InstantSend transaction is a valid transaction but does not receive a transaction lock, it reverts to being a standard transaction.\n\nThere are a number of limitations on InstantSend transactions:\n\n* The lock request will timeout 15 seconds after the first vote is seen (`INSTANTSEND_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`)\n* The lock request will fail if it has not been locked after 60 seconds (`INSTANTSEND_FAILED_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`)\n* A \u201cper-input\u201d fee of 0.0001 DASH per input is required for non-simple transactions (inputs >=5) since they place a higher load on the masternodes. This fee was most recently decreased by [DIP-0001](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0001.md).\n* To be used in an InstantSend transaction, an input must have at least the number confirmations (block depth) indicated by the table below\n\n| **Network** | **Confirmations Required** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mainnet | 6 Blocks |\n| Testnet | 2 Blocks |\n| Regtest | 2 Blocks |\n| Devnet  | 2 Blocks |\n\nThere are some further limitations on Automatic InstantSend transactions:\n\n* DIP3 must be active\n* Spork 16 must be enabled\n* Mempool usage must be lower than 10% (`AUTO_IX_MEMPOOL_THRESHOLD`). As of Dash Core 0.13.0, this corresponds to a mempool size of 30 MB (`DEFAULT_MAX_MEMPOOL_SIZE` = 300 MB).\n\n**Historical Note**\n\nPrior to Dash Core 0.13.0, `instantsend` and `instantlock` values were not available via RPC. At that time, the InstantSend system worked as described below.\n\nOnce a sufficient number of votes approved the transaction lock, the InstantSend transaction was approved and showed 5 confirmations (`DEFAULT_INSTANTSEND_DEPTH`).\n\nNOTE: The 5 \"pseudo-confirmations\" were shown to convey confidence that the transaction was secure from double-spending and DID NOT indicate the transaction had already been confirmed to a block depth of 5 in the blockchain.",
