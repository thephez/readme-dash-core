Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
TXID | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The TXID of the transaction that you want to abandon.  The TXID must be encoded as hex in RPC byte order

*Result---`null` on success*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required<br>(exactly 1) | JSON `null` when the transaction and all descendants were abandoned

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

# EncryptWallet

*Requires wallet support.*

The [`encryptwallet` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-encryptwallet) encrypts the wallet with a passphrase.  This is only to enable encryption for the first time. After encryption is enabled, you will need to enter the passphrase to use private keys.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "**Warning:** if using this RPC on the command line, remember that your shell probably saves your command lines (including the value of the passphrase parameter). In addition, there is no RPC to completely disable encryption. If you want to return to an unencrypted wallet, you must create a new wallet and restore your data from a backup made with the [`dumpwallet` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-dumpwallet)."
}
[/block]
*Parameter #1---a passphrase*

Name | Type | Presence | Description

`result` | string (base58) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | A P2PKH address which has not previously been returned by this RPC.  The address will be removed from the keypool but not marked as a receiving address, so RPCs such as the [`dumpwallet` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-dumpwallet) will show it as a change address.  The address may already have been part of the keypool, so other RPCs such as the [`dumpwallet` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-dumpwallet) may have disclosed it previously.  If the wallet is unlocked, its keypool will also be filled to its max (by default, 100 unused keys).  If the wallet is locked and its keypool is empty, this RPC will fail

The [`importprunedfunds` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-importprunedfunds) imports funds without the need of a rescan. Meant for use with pruned wallets. Corresponding address or script must previously be included in wallet.
The end-user is responsible to import additional transactions that subsequently spend the imported
outputs or rescan after the point in the blockchain the transaction is included.

*Parameter #1---the raw transaction to import*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Raw Transaction | string<br>(hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | A raw transaction in hex funding an already-existing address in wallet

*Parameter #2---the tx out proof that cointains the transaction*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
TX Out Proof | string<br>(hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The hex output from gettxoutproof that contains the transaction

*Result---`null` on success*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required<br>(exactly 1) | If the funds are added to wallet, JSON `null` will be returned

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.3*

``` bash
bitcoin-cli importprunedfunds "txhex" "txoutproof"
```

(Success: no result displayed.)

Rescan | bool | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | Set to `true` (the default) to rescan the entire local block database for transactions affecting any address or pubkey script in the wallet.  Set to `false` to not rescan the block database (rescanning can be performed at any time by restarting Dash Core with the `-rescan` command-line argument).  Rescanning may take several minutes.  Notes: if the address for this key is already in the wallet, the block database will not be rescanned even if this parameter is set

*Result---`null` on success*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required<br>(exactly 1) | If the public key is added to the wallet (or is already part of the wallet), JSON `null` will be returned

# ImportWallet

*Requires wallet support. Requires an unlocked wallet or an
unencrypted wallet.*

The [`importwallet` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-importwallet) imports private keys from a file in wallet dump file format (see the [`dumpwallet` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-dumpwallet)).

Mode | Description
--- | --- | --- |
`genkey` | Generates a base64 encoded 256 bit AES key that can be used for the communication with KeePassHttp. This is only necessary for manual configuration.
`init` | Sets up the association between Dash Core and KeePass by generating an AES key and sending an association message to KeePassHttp. This will trigger KeePass to ask for an Id for the association. Returns the association and the base64 encoded string for the AES key.
`setpassphrase` | Updates the passphrase in KeePassHttp to a new value. This should match the passphrase you intend to use for the wallet. Please note that the standard RPC commands walletpassphrasechange and the wallet encryption from the QT GUI already send the updates to KeePassHttp, so this is only necessary for manual manipulation of the password.

# SendMany

*Requires wallet support. Requires an unlocked wallet or an
unencrypted wallet.*

The [`sendmany` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-sendmany) creates and broadcasts a transaction which sends outputs to multiple addresses.

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
From Account | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | *Deprecated: will be removed in a later version of Dash Core*<br><br>The name of the account from which the dash should be spent.  Use an empty string (\\") for the default account. Dash Core will ensure the account has sufficient dash to pay the total amount in the *outputs* field described below (but the transaction fee paid is not included in the calculation, so an account can spend a total of its balance plus the transaction fee)"

*Parameter #2---the addresses and amounts to pay*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Outputs | object | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An object containing key/value pairs corresponding to the addresses and amounts to pay

![Warning icon](https://dash-docs.github.io/img/icons/icon_warning.svg)
**Warning:** if account1 receives an unconfirmed payment and transfers
it to account2 with the [`move` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-move), account2 will be able to spend those
dash even if this parameter is set to `1` or higher.

* [WalletLock](/docs/core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-walletlock): removes the wallet encryption key from memory, locking the wallet. After calling this method, you will need to call `walletpassphrase` again before being able to call any methods which require the wallet to be unlocked.
