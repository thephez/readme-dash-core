This section describes the Dash P2P network protocol (but it is not a specification). It does not describe the <<glossary:BIP70 payment protocol>>, the [GetBlockTemplate mining protocol](core-guide-mining-block-prototypes#getblocktemplate-rpc), or any network protocol never implemented in an official version of Dash Core.

All peer-to-peer communication occurs entirely over TCP.
