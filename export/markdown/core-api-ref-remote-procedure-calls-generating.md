The [`generate` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-generating#section-generate) mines blocks immediately (before the RPC call returns).

*Parameter #1---the number of blocks to generate*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`numblocks` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The number of blocks to generate.  The RPC call will not return until all blocks have been generated.

*Parameter #2---the number of iterations*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`maxtries` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The number of iterations to try (default = 1000000).

*Result---the generated block header hashes*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | array | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An array containing the block header hashes of the generated blocks (may be empty if used with `generate 0`)
→<br>Header Hashes | string (hex) | Required<br>(1 or more) | The hashes of the headers of the blocks generated in regtest mode, as hex in RPC byte order

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Using regtest mode, generate 2 blocks:

``` bash
dash-cli -regtest generate 2
```

Result:

``` json

*Added in Dash Core 0.12.3 / Bitcoin Core 0.13.0*

The [`generatetoaddress` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-generating#section-generate-to-address) mines blocks immediately to a specified address.

*Parameter #1---the number of blocks to generate*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Blocks | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The number of blocks to generate.  The RPC call will not return until all blocks have been generated or the maximum number of iterations has been reached

*Parameter #2---a transaction identifier (TXID)*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Address | string (base58) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The address that will receive the newly generated Dash

*Parameter #3---the maximum number of iterations to try*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Maxtries | number (int) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The maximum number of iterations that are tried to create the requested number of blocks.  Default is `1000000`

*Result---the generated block header hashes*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | array | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An array containing the block header hashes of the generated blocks (may be empty if used with `generate 0`)
→<br>Header Hashes | string (hex) | Required<br>(1 or more) | The hashes of the headers of the blocks generated, as hex in RPC byte order

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.3*

Using regtest mode, generate 2 blocks with maximal 500000 iterations:

``` bash
dash-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 2 "yaQzdWrDVYGncLKSKG4bHQ\
ML9UdAe726QN" 500000
```

Result:
