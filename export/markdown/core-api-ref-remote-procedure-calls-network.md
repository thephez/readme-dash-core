# AddNode

The [`addnode` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-network#section-add-node) attempts to add or remove a node from the addnode list, or to try a connection to a node once.

*Parameter #1---hostname/IP address and port of node to add or remove*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`node` | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The node to add as a string in the form of `<IP address>:<port>`.

*Parameter #2---whether to add or remove the node, or to try only once to connect*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`command` | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | What to do with the IP address above.  Options are:<br>• `add` to add a node to the addnode list.  Up to 8 nodes can be added additional to the default 8 nodes. Not limited by `-maxconnections`<br>• `remove` to remove a node from the list.  If currently connected, this will disconnect immediately<br>• `onetry` to immediately attempt connection to the node even if the outgoing connection slots are full; this will only attempt the connection once

*Result---`null` plus error on failed remove*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Always JSON `null` whether the node was added, removed, tried-and-connected, or tried-and-not-connected.  The JSON-RPC error field will be set only if you try adding a node that was already added or removing a node that is not on the addnodes list

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Try connecting to the following node.

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet addnode 192.0.2.113:19999 onetry
```

Result (no output from `dash-cli` because result is set to `null`).

*See also*

# ListBanned

*Added in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0*

The [`listbanned` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-network#section-list-banned) lists all banned IPs/Subnets.

*Parameters: none*

*Result---information about each banned IP/Subnet*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | object | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An array of objects each describing one entry. If there are no entries in the ban list, the array will be empty
→<br>Node | object | Optional<br>(0 or more) | A ban list entry
→ →<br>`address` | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The IP/Subnet of the entry
→ →<br>`banned_until` | number<br>(int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The Unix epoch time when the entry was added to the ban list
→ →<br>`ban_created` | number<br>(int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The Unix epoch time until the IP/Subnet is banned
→ →<br>`ban_reason` | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Set to one of the following reasons:<br>• `node misbehaving` if the node was banned by the client because of DoS violations<br>• `manually added` if the node was manually banned by the user

*Examples from Dash Core 0.12.2*

The default (`false`):

``` bash
dash-cli listbanned
```

Result:

``` json
[
  {
    "address": "192.0.2.201/32",
    "banned_until": 1507906175,
    "ban_created": 1507819775,
    "ban_reason": "node misbehaving"
  },
  {

    "banned_until": 1507906199,
    "ban_created": 1507819799,
    "ban_reason": "manually added"
  }

# Ping

The [`ping` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-network#section-ping) sends a P2P ping message to all connected nodes to measure ping time. Results are provided by the [`getpeerinfo` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-network#section-get-peer-info) pingtime and pingwait fields as decimal seconds. The P2P [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#section-ping) is handled in a queue with all other commands, so it measures processing backlog, not just network ping.

*Parameters: none*

*Result---`null`*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required | Always JSON `null`

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet ping
```

(Success: no result printed.)

Get the results using the [`getpeerinfo` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-network#section-get-peer-info):

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet getpeerinfo | grep ping
```

Results:

``` json
        "pingtime" : 0.11790800,
        "pingtime" : 0.22673400,
        "pingtime" : 0.16451900,
        "pingtime" : 0.12465200,
        "pingtime" : 0.13267900,
        "pingtime" : 0.23983300,
        "pingtime" : 0.16764700,
        "pingtime" : 0.11337300,
```

# SetBan

*Added in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0*

The [`setban` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-network#section-set-ban) attempts add or remove a IP/Subnet from the banned list.

*Parameter #1---IP/Subnet of the node*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
IP(/Netmask) | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The node to add or remove as a string in the form of `<IP address>`.  The IP address may be a hostname resolvable through DNS, an IPv4 address, an IPv4-as-IPv6 address, or an IPv6 address

*Parameter #2---whether to add or remove the node*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Command | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | What to do with the IP/Subnet address above.  Options are:<br>• `add` to add a node to the addnode list<br>• `remove` to remove a node from the list.  If currently connected, this will disconnect immediately

*Parameter #3---time how long the ip is banned*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Bantime | numeric<br>(int) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | Time in seconds how long (or until when if `absolute` is set) the entry is banned. The default is 24h which can also be overwritten by the -bantime startup argument

*Parameter #4---whether a relative or absolute timestamp*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Absolute | bool | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | If set, the bantime must be a absolute timestamp in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT)

*Result---`null` on success*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Always JSON `null`

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Ban the following node.

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet setban 192.0.2.113 add 2592000
```

Result (no output from `dash-cli` because result is set to `null`).

*See also*

* [ListBanned](/docs/core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-network#section-list-banned): lists all banned IPs/Subnets.
* [ClearBanned](/docs/core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-network#section-clear-banned): clears list of banned nodes.

# SetNetworkActive

*Added in Bitcoin Core 0.14.0*

The [`setnetworkactive` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-network#section-set-network-active) disables/enables all P2P network activity.

*Parameter #1---whether to disable or enable all P2P network activity*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Activate | bool | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Set to `true` to enable all P2P network activity. Set to `false` to disable all P2P network activity

*Result---`null` or error on failure*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | null | Required<br>(exactly 1) | JSON `null`.  The JSON-RPC error field will be set only if you entered an invalid parameter

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

``` bash
dash-cli setnetworkactive true
```

Result (no output from `dash-cli` because result is set to `null`).
