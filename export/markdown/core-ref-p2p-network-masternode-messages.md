# ssc

The [`ssc` message](core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages#ssc) is used to track the sync status of masternode objects. This message is sent in response to sync requests for the list of governance objects (`govsync` message), and governance object votes (`govsync` message).

| Bytes | Name | Data type | Required | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| 4 | nItemID | int | Required | Masternode Sync Item ID
| 4 | nCount | int | Required | Number of items to sync

Sync Item IDs

| ID | Description | Response To
|------|--------------|---------------
| 2 | MASTERNODE_SYNC_LIST | _Deprecated following activation of [DIP3](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0003.md) in Dash Core 0.13.0_<br><br>`dseg` message
| 3 | MASTERNODE_SYNC_MNW | _Deprecated following activation of [DIP3](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0003.md) in Dash Core 0.13.0_<br><br>`mnget` message
| 10 | MASTERNODE_SYNC_GOVOBJ | [`govsync` message](core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages#govsync)
| 11 | MASTERNODE_SYNC_GOVOBJ_VOTE | [`govsync` message](core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages#govsync) with non-zero hash

# mnauth

*Added in protocol version 70214 of Dash Core*

The [`mnauth` message](core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages#mnauth) is sent by a <<glossary:masternode>> immediately after sending a [`verack` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#verack) to authenticate that the sender is a masternode. It is only sent when the sender is actually a masternode.

The [`mnauth` message](core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages#mnauth) signs a challenge that was previously sent via a [`version` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version). The challenge is signed differently depending on if the connection is inbound or outbound.

This is primarily used as a DoS protection mechanism to allow persistent connections between masternodes to remain open even if inbound connection limits are reached.

| Bytes | Name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 32 | proRegTxHash | uint256 | Version of the message
| 96 | sig | byte[] | BLS signature, signed with the operator key of the masternode
