# Deterministic Wallet Formats

## Type 1: Single Chain Wallets

A Type 1 deterministic <<glossary:wallet>> is the simpler of the two, which can create a single series of keys from a single seed. A primary weakness is that if the seed is leaked, all funds are compromised, and wallet sharing is extremely limited.

## Type 2: Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets

For an overview of the <<glossary:HD wallet>>, please see the [developer guide section](core-guide-wallets).  For details, please see [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki).
