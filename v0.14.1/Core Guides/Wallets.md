A Dash wallet can refer to either a wallet program or a wallet file. Wallet programs create public keys to receive duffs and use the corresponding private keys to spend those duffs. Wallet files store private keys and (optionally) other information related to transactions for the wallet program.

Wallet programs and wallet files are addressed below in separate subsections, and this document attempts to always make it clear whether we're talking about wallet programs or wallet files.
